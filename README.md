## Project Idea

An application that utilizes facial detection and recognition to find the user in the background of any photos online.
The idea is to allow users to see the photos they are involved in, for example, if one goes to a tourist destination a lot of photos are being taken and uploaded online. The user can use our application to find themselves in the backgrounds of other peoples (publically accesible) photos. Another option is for users to upload an album (from a trip, vacation, group activity, etc) and the application will detect any photo with them in it.

### Authentication

Users would first need to provide enough information to create an account. The account would need to be verified to avoid any possible abusive action towards the application (using the tool in any manner that would affect someone else privacy). After logging in, the user can upload their photo to find their pictures.

### Local photo finding tool

This feature will allows users to upload an album of their recent trip where they hang out with friends or colleagues. The user will also need to provide an up-to-date photo of themselves. The application will look through the album and try to match the user's face with other people it can find in the photos. The result will be a set of photos with the user in it.

### Online photo finding tool

This feature allows users to search for their photo from a publically accessible album online. Noted that this feature requires the targeted website to have an API so the album can be retrieved and be used for reference.
