## Back-End

The app will be served by an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) server hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The server will use a Django framework to process requests from the client, and search up client information from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. The server will also process images using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library and perform API calls to [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) to get additional images.

## Front-End

The front-end of the app will also utilize the Django framework and Bootstrap to provide a responsive experience to the end-user. 

## Developing Tools

This web application will be made using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a Python extension. Postman will be used to test various HTTP requests and responses to debug and coordinate front-end with back-end tasks.
